## What is chad/ui?

chad/ui is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your Django apps.

Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), chad/ui builds on [shadcn-django](https://github.com/shadcn-django)'s great foundation and faithful port of shadcn/ui to Django.
It's a slightly different & opinionated flavor with:

- 🧩 **Additional components** - File upload, filter, radio group, spinner, and more
- 🔌 **Third-party integrations** - AG Grid, TradingView widgets, etc.
- 🛠️ **Backend integration** - Seamless data fetch, client-side validation, etc.
- 📱 **Enhanced patterns & design** - Radix-aligned composition and APIs, responsive layouts, improved mobile interactions, visual feedback during async requests, etc. 

If you want the core, basic shadcn/ui experience in Django, use shadcn-django. If you would like these additional features and enhancements, use chad/ui.
